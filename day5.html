                <p name="d">Lunar New Year Festival often falls between late January and early February; 
                   it is among the most important holidays in Vietnam. Officially, the festival
                   includes the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd day in Lunar Calendar; however, Vietnamese people
                   often spend nearly a month celebrating this special event. Tet Holiday gets its 
                   beginning marked with the first day in the Lunar Year; however, its preparation 
                   starts long before that.</p>
